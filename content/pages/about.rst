Hello, this site will contain all my musings and updates surrounding game developement.

I first started learning to program because I wanted to make games. 
But, when I entered the corporate world my game dev took a backseat.

The primary intention of this blog is to give me a place to track my game dev, and something to reflect upon.
It is not intended to be educational or useful to anyone else, but if it is then that's an added bonus.
